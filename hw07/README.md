## HOMEWORK 6: PRACTICE WITH FUNCTIONS, LOOPS, DOM MANIPULATION, AND CONDITIONALS
This was a great homework because it introduced me to CodePen, and the fun
JavaScript exercises that you have devised for us.

## Part I: Self Study
Loops
The "Intro to Loops" is interesting and good review for me.
I didn't quite understand the use of labels with loops or where such a
construct would be used.

### B. Adding DOM Elements
This material was a great review of the class lecture and helped me to
understand how to "surgically" add elements to the DOM. The importance
of naming ids and classes in a meaningful manner has become apparent if
we are to understand how to manipulate the DOM.

### C. Functions
The article from web-design-weekly was not helpful at all. It used the old way of
declaring functions, introduced scope in a weird manner and brought up the topic
of hoisting which is a totally bizarre concept ...!

### D. Conditional Statements
What are truthy and falsy? This is not a clear concept; sounds fishy to me.

### E. Math
Yes, the old remainder/modulus function is very useful when you want to know if
a number is divisible by another.


## Part II: GitHub Setup
How does github know to download the next assignment into my folder on my
laptop? It's like magic!

## Part III: Coding
This was fun to do!
