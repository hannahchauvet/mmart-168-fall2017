# HOMEWORK 5: MANIPULATING TWITTER DATA WITH FUNCTIONS
To complete this homework, I did some research into the methods defined for an
HTML element's classList.
I found several:
contains - which returns true if the name is present in the classList
remove - which removes a name from the classList
add - which adds a name to the classList
toggle - which adds a name if it not present and removes it if it is present
These methods were which were exactly what I needed.

As usual, the most difficult part of the assignment was figuring out what the
existing code was doing. I did some reading about SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
and wondered how that long list of numbers ended up as a star.
I also figured out that I had to change the id of each tweet in order to make
each one respond to its own click.
I added a scale transform to the css file so that the star would enlarge a little
when it was clicked. There seemed to be a bounding box around the star because
it would only enlarge up to a point.

This was a fun assignment but I want to know more about SVG.
